<p>I am ready to pursue a PhD</p>

<p>The purpose of creating this page is to have a larger space to express myself and share my views on pursuing a PhD.</p>
  <h2 onclick="toggleContent(this)">I have a strong passion for continuing research as a PhD student</h2>
  <div class="content">
    People are not inherently destined to do research, but they are inherently driven to continually explore the world.
    There are various ways to explore the world, and I tend to choose the path of scientific research. Even before undergoing any formal research training, I instinctively used the method of controlling variables to investigate why the stewed meat was not juicy; recognizing the generality and specificity of problems has been a smooth process for me since childhood. I am unwilling to simply accept answers that are given to me, and I always want to explore by myself, to satisfy my curiosity. This is not a disciplinary requirement for me, but more like a habit of life. Therefore, I knew I would undergo training to gain the qualifications to conduct independent research at some point in my life. I want to discover new knowledge and promote technological progress through my own efforts; this is a process I can achieve self-realization.
  </div>

  <h2 onclick="toggleParentContent(this)">I learned how to do research through past research experiences</h2>
  <div class="content">
    
    <p>It is far from enough just having the passion for research; I think I also need to know how to do research - And this can only be discovered through practice. I must first engage in the research to understand what it is like, to know if I am capable, and to identify aspects where I need to learn and improve. Therefore, I have been actively seeking opportunities to do research.</p>
    <p>When I was in college, it seemed that no lab was recruiting undergraduates due to a lack of members. Even though, I actively ask professors if there were opportunities to get involved. Eventually, I joined a group studying the anticancer effects of plant extracts. After some basic training, I independently generated a bit of useful data.</p>
    <p>When I entered graduate school, I was very clear from the start that I wanted to find opportunities in the lab, but things did not go as planned. Due to initial language barriers and the subsequent pandemic issue, I was unable to engage in research and even failed to get to know many professors and students in my own department. After the pandemic, I proactively introduced myself to professors and finally got the chance to work on some protein extraction and crystallization work for structural determination before graduation.</p>
    <p>After earning my master's degree, I still felt that I lacked comprehensive experience in scientific research and had a limited systematic understanding of how to conduct research. Therefore, I chose to find a job in the lab and continue doing research as a research technician.</p>

    <h3 onclick="toggleSubContent(this)">Challenges encountered and efforts to overcome them</h3>
    <div class="sub-content">
        <p>Case 1 - PCR: I was asked if it was possible to quantify the bacteria colonizing in the co-culture system using PCR. Based on what I had learned, it theoretically works. Additionally, I found it easy to discover papers mentioning that others have done this. However, all of these papers lacked details, and our co-culture experiments had some personalized requirements for the samples. To explore the possibility of quantifying bacteria in our project, I first prepared a series of dilutions of the target bacterial culture. qPCR was applied to these serial dilutions. However, the results were unsatisfactory. I encountered a problem: the Cq value did not change much in bacterial samples with different concentrations and could not accurately reflect the number of bacteria.</p>
        <p>To solve this problem, I considered that the issue might lie in one of two stages: the DNA extraction process or the PCR process. It could be due to operational errors during DNA extraction, inadequate lysis of the bacteria, loss or degradation of DNA molecules, or the presence of PCR inhibitors in the samples; It might also be due to errors in primer validation or issues during the PCR process leading to unreliable results. Instead of aimlessly troubleshooting them one by one, I first wanted to pinpoint which stage was the source of the problem. To do this, I purchased bacterial DNA standards and created serial dilutions to run PCR. The experimental data was very promising - the PCR results accurately reflected the changes in bacterial DNA quantity. With this experimental outcome, I quickly identified that the problem lay with the DNA samples and their extraction process, rather than the PCR primers or the PCR itself. At that point, I focused on trying different DNA extraction kits and checking the quality of the DNA using gel electrophoresis then. Ultimately, we overcame this issue. </p>
        <p>Initially, I only had experience with regular PCR learned in my lab tech course. In order to do the experiment well I independently explored everything related to RT-qPCR, including calculating primer amplification efficiency, verifying the size of the target fragment using melting curve analysis, and optimizing amplification conditions, eventually becoming the expert on PCR issues in the lab to assist and guide other team members.</p>
        <p>Case 2 - Organoids culturing: it has not successfully maintained long-term organoid cultures before. Attempts to replace Caco-2 cells with organoids in experiments design have failed due to a lack of culturing experience. When I joined, my first task in the position was to establish successful organoid cultures in the lab. To achieve this, I began by reading many relevant papers and collecting different protocols and comparing their similarities and differences. Additionally, I sought out experiences from others cultivating gastrointestinal organoids on both Chinese and English forums. Initially, the organoid culture was successfully established in matrigel; however, after a couple of passages, the organoids suddenly began to die together. This occurred without any changes to the protocols, culture conditions, or media, leading me to suspect it is because of some external contamination. However, no bacterial or fungal contamination was observed. After the mycoplasma test kit I ordered arrived, I pinpointed the source of the issue.</p>
        <p>Then another problem began to trouble us: Some bubble-like structures started to appear in the matrigel. These structures caused the disintegration of matrigel domes and the loss of organoids. Since these strange structures resembled gas accumulation, I initially suspected it is another kind of contamination from yeast or similar organisms that produce gas. However, test results did not support this hypothesis. Through continuous imaging of one location, I discovered that these bubble-like structures are actually membrane structures left behind after the organoids disintegrate and died, rather than gases. Ultimately, this problem was resolved by replacing different batches of matrigel.</p>
        <p>As experience accumulated, I became more and more proficient in organoid culture. Then I noticed that the health of organoid cultures was getting worse with the number of passages; The passage cycle was also getting longer and longer. At this time, I had spontaneously done some reading and was familiar with the background knowledge of organoid spheroids and their differentiation, as well as the role of each component of the organoid media. Since co-culture requires a large number of organoids, our strategy was to obtain the largest volume of culturing before subculturing. However, due to the asynchronous growth of organoids in the same dome, when some organoids grow up, other spheroids have already been overcultured. Over time, the vigorously growing cells have already differentiated, and we are actually passaged those unhealthy, slow-growing stem cells left. I proved this through PCR measuring of those stem/differentiated cells markers, and greatly improved our culturing quality. In the end, the organoids were cultured for up to 19 passages, which met the requirements of our experiments.</p>

  <h2 onclick="toggleContent(this)">I reflect on my work instead of doing it thoughtlessly</h2>
  <div class="content">
    <p>Initially, we decided to inoculate the engineered bacteria directly onto the matrigel with organoids. However, during implementation, I realized there were issues with this approach. On one hand, when investigating the impact of bacteria on gene expression in cells, it's important to consider not only the influence of soluble components like metabolites and signaling molecules but also the effects of adhesion molecules and surface receptors resulting from direct contact with the sample. On the other hand, under this co-culture condition, what is actually quantified is the number of bacteria colonized on the matrigel rather than the number of bacteria colonized on the tissue surface. For this reason, I took the initiative to read materials to find a better way to improve the co-culture system to be closer to the real environment of the intestine, and then introduced and successfully implemented several more improved co-culture approaches. Additionally, I proposed that for the direct contact co-culture setups, we should first verify the formation of the mucus layer before bacterial inoculation using immunoassays and PCR methods</p> 
  </div>
  <h2 onclick="toggleContent(this)">I am ready in terms of physical and mental health</h2>
  <div class="content">
    Compared to when I just graduated from college, I am now more mature in my outlook. Over the past few years, I have faced various challenges in research. some of them were resolved, while others were not. Even for those that were solved, there were many moments of struggle. I've realized that research is often not as smooth as it seems. For example, even when everything that could be done was done, I still didn't have my publication in hand right now as expected. I can now respond calmly to the uncertainties of research, no longer feeling as frustrated as I did when I encountered difficulties for the first time and not easily discouraged by new challenges. I have enough experience balancing research with life, and I can manage stress while staying healthy and productive. I believe that maintaining openness, optimism, and health is essential for doing research.
  </div>
  <h2 onclick="toggleContent(this)">I am ready in terms of academic ability</h2>
  <div class="content">
    <p>From my current understanding, pursuing a PhD requires a solid knowledge base in the discipline, an understanding of research methods, and the ability to apply and practice these skills. It requires proficiency in information gathering, filtering, and logical analysis, along with an openness to new concepts and unfamiliar fields. I believe I meet the qualification, although it's difficult to prove it outside of research practice. Maybe GPA can serve as a partial indicator. Initially, I encountered some obstacles in achieving high grades due to a combination of subjective and objective factors. However, I soon adapted to the new academic environment, and It's noticeable that my grades have improved in the last few semesters. At this point, balancing coursework with research is no longer an issue for me. </p>
    <p>Still, I wonder if there is a way to improve even further. I have no trouble understanding and applying knowledge, but I don't invest a lot in memorizing details in the hope of getting better grades. For example, I consider it important to understand how different amino acids ionize at various pH levels and to know key concepts like isoelectric points and pKa; But I don't have enough motivation to remember the English names of all specific amino acids because I don't value their help in my research. Being able to remember the former indicates that there are no physiological barriers in processes like synaptic long-term potentiation and the synthesis of proteins such as receptors. Not recalling the latter likely reflects that I have yet to apply study findings on the relationship between emotion and memory to my own learning practices. I will continue to improve based on these reflections and self-assessments.</p>
  </div>
  <h2 onclick="toggleContent(this)">I can drive myself to do research</h2>
  <div class="content">
    I can actively push forward the research progress without external supervision. When the professor is busy or away, we might meet only once a week or even not. If we discuss and decide to use PCR for bacterial quantification analysis or to prepare our own complete medium, the objective itself is enough to get me to act. I can explore methods to achieve this on my own, plan the experiments independently, advance the work, and regularly report research progress and any issues I face. Therefore, I have a wide adaptability to different guidance models. I can diligently complete the tasks assigned to me, while also taking the initiative in my own work. I clearly know areas where I may lack understanding and the problems I encounter, and I am able to seek appropriate help in a timely and proactive manner.
  </div>
  <h2 onclick="toggleContent(this)">I have no obstacles working in a team</h2>
  <div class="content">
    I deeply understand that research is a collaborative effort. When I first joined the lab, the previous PhD students had either graduated or transferred away, so I essentially had to start from scratch. It was challenging — Even the details of lab work done in previous publications are unfamiliar to me. As new members gradually joined, I began to train them carefully in everything from sterile techniques to tissue culture and molecular biology experiments. Each time I overcome a technical challenge, I would teach students this reproducible and mature experimental method and then shift my focus to exploring the next techniques that the lab needed but hadn't yet tackled. I was always happy to help others when they had questions, and equally willing to learn through them whenever I faced difficulties. I could find individualized and effective ways to work with different team members toward our common goals, even though each person had a unique personality. When I left, the students in the lab surprised me with a custom-designed mug with my name on it as a farewell gift. So, I guess they did enjoy our time together in the lab.
  </div>
  <h2 onclick="toggleContent(this)">I deeply understand the importance of communication and expression</h2>
  <div class="content">
    <p>When I just came to this country, I didn't choose to pursue a PhD right away, as I anticipated a significant language barrier. It wasn't that I couldn't speak English but compared to my above-average proficiency in Chinese, my English expression was too weak to faithfully convey my thoughts, both academically and in daily life. This often made me reluctant to speak, feeling foolish when doing that. Reflecting on my early research experiences during my master's program, I realize they would have been smoother if I hadn't been so hesitant to talk, especially when I had questions about the availability of rotors for the centrifuge or wanted to borrow some missing reagents from the neighboring lab.</p>
    <p>When I realized this, I knew I must overcome it no matter what, if I wanted to continue my research career. Therefore, I sought a position in the lab to have more opportunities for academic communication. I proactively expressed my views on research and consciously worked on improving my communication skills. This has made my recent research experience very different from before. I no longer have any fear or shame about speaking; instead, I feel a sense of anticipation. And the level of expression has also visibly improved.</p>
  </div>
  <h2 onclick="toggleContent(this)">Diligent and Responsible</h2>
  <div class="content">
    Given differences in ideas, funding, and skill levels, the academic value of research can vary. Regardless, as long as the work is meaningful, I hold great respect for what I am working on. I have no doubt that my research aptitude and intellectual capacity are qualified. But the point is there are also many other people who are qualified while the research resources and opportunities are limited. Therefore, I greatly value the training and work opportunities in the lab. I respect the objectivity of experimental results as well as the effort that both others and I invest in them. I can accept experimental failures if there is something to learn from them, but I do not tolerate unproductive work due to negligence, as it just wastes both my time and others'. For a long time, I was the only one in the lab who could successfully perform surgeries to obtain stem cells and establish organoid culture; The qPCR results I produce always show minimal variability between technical replicates, almost negligible. Considering that the common experiment protocol we use is there, I think this may be attributed to my more careful operation, and I consciously think about the purpose of each step and find ways to optimize them in detail.
  </div>
  <h2 onclick="toggleContent(this)">Experimental Records</h2>
  <div class="content">
    Honestly, my lab notes are a little ugly. Readability is what I need to improve next: sometimes the handwriting is sloppy; sometimes I write on electronic devices and don't file them in time; sometimes I forget the spelling of words and use the wrong version or Chinese instead, especially when time is tight. However, I always can ensure that I accurately record what truly happens in the experiments, knowing which details are essential for making conclusion and ensuring reproducibility. For experiments that are handled jointly, everyone tends to check my notebook to verify the details. Additionally, I also designed a naming system for our cultures to facilitate the management, archiving, and storage of various samples: healthy organoids, tumor organoids, Caco-2, those from collaborators, those from my own mouse models, and so on.
  </div>
  <h2 onclick="toggleContent(this)">Critical Thinking</h2>
  <div class="content">
    <p>In my early validation experiments using Caco-2 cells as samples, I found that the experimental results had low reproducibility. This was primarily due to a lack of consistency between cell samples. I noticed some black dots have non-directional motion in certain wells. They resembled microbial contaminants, although they didn't cloud the culture media. The professor believed they could be the stress granule vibrating under the imaging system. However, as the one observing these cultures daily, I had reason to doubt this. Rather than accepting it directly, I decided to seek experimental evidence to support my perspective. I attempted to distinguish these particles based on the chemical nature differences between microbes and stress granule. So, I collected the particles from the medium, enriched them by centrifugation, and immediately fixed them for simple identification using DNA staining. To further support my view, I also used methods such as moving the cultures to the anti-vibration platform in confocal microscope room and plating the unknown sample on dish to figure out.</p>
    <p>When I read about a gene expression change being described as a “significant increase” or “slight change”, I won't just assume the former represents a larger change than the latter. Rather than simply accepting a publication's conclusion, I carefully check the sample size, data standard deviations and the conditions of the experimental/control groups. Also compare it with the data I've generated on the same gene.</p>
  </div>
  <h2 onclick="toggleContent(this)">My passion for research is sustainable</h2>
  <div class="content">
    My desire to do research is a carefully considered decision, not a passing impulse. It is self-awareness I developed after already having a basic understanding of how to do research and how a lab runs. My passion for scientific research has never changed, even when I was distressed because I couldn't understand English speeches, when I was anxious about living alone in a room with no lab to go to during the epidemic, when I refused to do technical work in the company and chose to stay close to research in the lab, when the results of the experiment were unsatisfactory but I couldn't find the reason. Therefore, I think no matter what difficulties I encounter in the future, I will not give up this passion easily. I think this is enough to build up my confidence to face the next journey of PhD career, coupled with my diligence and intelligence.
  </div>
  <h2 onclick="toggleContent(this)">Current Skills and Future Aspirations</h2>
  <div class="content">
    <p>Through my past experiences, I have developed a fundamental understanding of how to conduct research. When designing experiments, I focus closely on the questions I aim to answer; I consciously validate and set controls to defend my conclusions logically; I seek answers to my doubts and find solutions by searching for and reading relevant publications; and I look for innovative points based on the limitations of previous studies. I am capable of successfully completing basic molecular biology experiments and have the ability to self-learn and master new experimental methods for which I have no prior experience. However, many of these details have been self-summarized and imitated through practice and publications. When I share these insights with new students in the lab, I often wonder if there are more established versions available. Therefore, I hope to make further progress in these areas through upcoming research opportunities, collaborating with others, and learning from them, from practical experiences.</p>
    <p>Additionally, I aspire to receive more systematic training in data processing. I increasingly realize that sometimes the handling of experimental data is as important as the experiments themselves. Currently, I rely on biostatistics textbooks and online resources, learning opportunistically based on research needs, which feels not so systematic. I hope for opportunities to learn more from others' work or gain more practical experience for self-study. I also wish to be exposed to a wider range of mathematical tools.</p>
    <p>Importantly, I am seeking opportunities for training in written and verbal academic communication.</p>
    <p>Lastly, I often have thoughts regarding research. It would be wonderful if there is chance to discuss these with more experienced people. For instance, before pursuing higher education, I believed that research involved observing a phenomenon, which must be reproducible, and summarizing a rule from that observation. However, I now understand that research is not like that. In writing proposals, one must have expectations for the results and clarify the significance of the research, which should be problem-solving oriented. I wonder whether it is more about designing experiments to prove a hypothesis based on expectations or deriving possible conclusions from the results obtained - Is the logic of storytelling the same as that of conducting experiments?</p>
  </div>
  <h2 onclick="toggleContent(this)">Academic Interests</h2>
  <div class="content">
    <p>I feel that the academic interest itself doesn't mean a lot. As long as one's understanding of the world remains open and continues to grow with life experiences, their interests are unlikely to remain fixed. Interests are fluid. I'd like to talk about how mine have evolved:</p>
    <p>When I first became able to read, I wasn't especially drawn to life sciences. I was fascinated by archaeology and astronomy, spending all my time reading at the library nearby, captivated by the history hidden beneath the earth and the vast star systems beyond the sky. Many years later, I realized this represented a child's initial curiosity about the world in the dimensions of time and space.</p>
    <p>Within this framework of time and space, I absorbed as much knowledge about the world as possible and took pride in knowing more than most kids my age I knew. In middle school, as I was introduced to subjects like physics and biology, my interests began to shift towards them. Later, as my social relationship developed, I started exploring basic questions in philosophy and social sciences. It was then that I realized something important: a learning approach focused solely on accumulating knowledge no longer attracted me, because I discovered that knowledge existed beyond textbooks and that it was impossible to know everything about the world. My interest shifted to exploring the general principles behind this knowledge.</p>
    <p>When it came time to select courses before entering college, I gave this much thought. Ultimately, my conclusion was that life sciences, especially neurobiology, hold a special and essential position within the entire scientific system. On the one hand, biology is a bridge connecting different parts of science. Life science is built upon a foundation of natural sciences like physics and chemistry, and it represents the manifestation of physical and chemical principles at the level of living phenomena. All social sciences explore relationships between people in various ways, and for one to be part of society, one must first exist as a natural being. Humans cannot escape its biological essence as an animal. Therefore, studying humans as a biological individual is crucial for understanding in social sciences. Moreover, when it comes to psychology, every phenomenon has an underlying biological basis that deserves exploration, making it intricately connected with neurobiology. On the other hand, my curiosity and reflections about the world come from me as an individual. If the world is too vast for me to fully grasp, I can focus first on understanding what I am. Clearly, I am a living being. And I must ensure my own healthy existence before I can hope to learn more about the world. This insight guided me through the crisis of choosing subjects in high school.</p>
    <p>Following my study of biology and hands-on research, my interests remain rooted in cognitive neuroscience questions such as the biological basis of consciousness, early neural development, and aging. At the same time, my thoughts have evolved further.</p>
    <p>To some extent, research is driven by the tools available. Every time new tools and methods are invented, fields seem to experience a big advancement. Consequently, I am now very interested in research methods such as optogenetics and calcium imaging etc. Simply reading about their strengths and limitations isn't enough for me; I want to use and develop them in practice. Mastering these tools would enable me to use them to explore any interesting question.</p>
    <p>I'm also becoming interested in model development and systems biology. Based on past experiences, I feel that focusing solely on a single gene or protein, rather than their interactions within the entire network, may not be reliable. Thus, I hope to approach questions by examining various levels, including nucleic acids, proteins, electrical signals, and behavior.</p>
    <p>With the growth of omics like genomics, transcriptomics and connectomes, we now have more accessible datasets. I wonder if it might be possible for me to use these resources at the bioinformatics level to identify questions worth validating through experiments.</p>
