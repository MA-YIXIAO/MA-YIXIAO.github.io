<p>I am ready to pursue a PhD

    The purpose of creating this page is to have a larger space to express myself and share my views on pursuing a PhD.</p>
  <h2 onclick="toggleContent(this)">I have a strong passion for continuing research as a PhD student</h2>
  <div class="content">
    People are not inherently destined to do research, but they are inherently driven to continually explore the world.
    There are various ways to explore the world, and I tend to choose the path of scientific research. Even before undergoing any formal research training, I instinctively used the method of controlling variables to investigate why the stewed meat was not juicy; recognizing the generality and specificity of problems has been a smooth process for me since childhood. I am unwilling to simply accept answers that are given to me, and I always want to explore by myself, to satisfy my curiosity. This is not a disciplinary requirement for me, but more like a habit of life. Therefore, I knew I would undergo training to gain the qualifications to conduct independent research at some point in my life. I want to discover new knowledge and promote technological progress through my own efforts; this is a process I can achieve self-realization.

    <p>is far from enough just having the passion to do research; I think I also need to know how to do research - And this can only be discovered through practice. I must first engage in the research to understand what it is like, to know if I am capable, and to identify aspects where I need to learn and improve. Therefore, I have been actively seeking opportunities to do research.</p> 
    <p>When I was in college, it seemed that no lab was recruiting undergraduates due to a lack of members. However, I took the initiative to ask professors if there were opportunities to get involved. Eventually, I joined a research group studying the anticancer effects of plant extracts. After some basic training, I independently generated a bit of useful data.
    </p>
    <p>When I entered graduate school, I was very clear from the start that I wanted to find opportunities in the lab, but things did not go as planned. Due to initial language barriers and the subsequent pandemic issue, I was unable to engage in research and even failed to get to know many professors and students in my own department. After the pandemic, I proactively introduced myself to professors and finally got the chance to work on some protein extraction and crystallization for structural determination before graduation.</p>
